    <p><i>Who's taller?</i> was created by a tall guy who is trying to learn web development and that has always wondered which famous people were taller than him.</p>
    <p>The inspiration came from the <a href="http://www.higherlowergame.com/"><b>Higher Lower Game</b></a>, one of the most addictive games you'll ever play.</p>
